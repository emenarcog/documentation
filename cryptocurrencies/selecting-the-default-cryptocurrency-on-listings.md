# Selecting the default cryptocurrency on listings

On the Spacelens platform, you can see the price of products and services in fiat currencies \(ex: $\) as well as their equivalent in the cryptocurrency of your choice.

In order to change the cryptocurrency on each listing, simply go to your profile and click on the settings \(the button is on the top right of your screen on mobile\).

In the settings, you will see a preferred crypto section where you can then select the one that you want to use.
