# Changing the cover picture

In order to change the cover picture that appears on your profile, simply visit your profile tab and click on the cover picture.

You will get a chance to select to use one of the existing pictures on your phone or to take a new picture.

Once you have selected a picture, you will also see a cropping tool so you can decide which part of the picture you want to use for your cover image.
