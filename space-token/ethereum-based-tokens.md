# Ethereum based tokens

There are many different blockchains that exist. The most famous examples are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Block Chains for example.

Among other standards and chains, the Ethereum blockchain allows for the creation of ERC-20 tokens which are tokens that live on the Ethereum blockchain. For example our [SPACE token](https://spacetoken.spacelens.com/) is an ERC-20 token which has been created on the Ethereum blockchain.

On Spacelens, you and others can send and receive any ERC-20 tokens that are created on the Ethereum blockchain. There are thousands of Ethereum tokens that exist.

What is also important to note is to be careful with ERC-20 tokens you interact with and to always make sure you are transacting with the right token as it is easy for someone to create a similar token and give it the same name. **Always check the contract address of a token.** In the case of ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum, the Etherscan to check if you are interacting with the right token.

The official Etherscan address of the SPACE coin can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcc7ab8d78dBA187dC95bF3bB86e65E0C26d0041f).
