# Finding products on the map

When you are using Spacelens, you can navigate and scroll the map at anytime to see the latest offerings. When several products, services or offers are located at the same location, you will a pin on the map with the number of offers at that particular location.

If you click on the pin, a pop-up will appear allowing you to see all the different offers that exist and scroll down on that list.

If you click one of these offers, you will open the detail and description of that specific offer. If a single user has published offers in that location, you will have also the option to click on their profile picture to be redirected to their profile.
