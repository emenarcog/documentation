# Selecting the default currency for a product or service

You can select in which currency you want to sell a particular product or service on Spacelens. By default, the currency selected will be the one used in your country but you can decide at anytime to change that.

To do so, simply click on the currency symbol when you are creating your product or service in the "Sell" tab. This will open a list of all available currencies in the marketplace and let you choose the one that is right for you.
