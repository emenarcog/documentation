# Change or update a picture in a listing

You can always make edits or changes to a listing you have created on Spacelens if that listing was not created on the blockchain. 

For listings created on the traditional interface, you simply need to visit your profile and access the list of the different offers or posts you have created.

Next to each posts, you will see a little pen icon. When you click on this icon, you will be able to edit any part of your listing such as title, description as well as price, pictures, and videos.

Once you have made the changes required, simply click on the update to publish the changes instantly.

### What about what I have published on the blockchain?

When you create or publish something on the blockchain, it is sent and become immutable. This means you won't be able to change certain types of information or content as they are now stored on a global ledger which can't be altered.

⚠️ Be mindful of what you publish on the blockchain as you will never be able to change it.
